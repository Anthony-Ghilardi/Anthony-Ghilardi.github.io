# Milestone-Project-1-Anthony-Ghilardi

## Description

The objective of this game is to collect as much meat as possible within one minute. You will begin the game by clicking the "Start Game" button to accomplish this goal. The timer will then begin counting down, allowing you to move your character. Control inputs and other instructions can be found below. How much meat can you eat? Remember to have fun! 

## Deployment

My deployed game can be found at [(https://anthony-ghilardi.github.io/Milestone-Project-1/)]

## Game Logic

When you begin the game, randomly generated pieces of meat will spawn across the play area. The player will have the choice to collect any meat in any order they please. Upon collecting a piece of meat, the score counter will increase by one. After collecting all meat in the play area, a new series of meat will spawn on the map, and the player will continue to collect meat until the one-minute timer expires. Once the one-minute timer expires, the player will be presented with a game over screen, including their final score and instructions on how to replay the game.

How to start the game:
- Click the "Start Game" button
- This will begin the one-minute timer
- This will also create the play area and allow you to begin moving your character

Control Inputs:
Each key should be pressed and held down to maintain movement:

- W = Moves character Up
- S = Moves character Down
- A = Moves character Left
- D = Moves character Right

Multiple keys can be pressed at once to cause diagonal movement:

- W + D = Moves the character diagonally Up and to the Right
- W + A = Moves the character diagonally Up and to the Left
- S + D = Moves the character diagonally Down and to the Right
- S + A = Moves the character diagonally Down and to the Left

How to restart the game:
- Refresh your browser after being presented with the game over screen.

## Post-MVP Plans

- Add a restart button which will cause the game to restart, rather than having to refresh the browser.
- Create a local leaderboard to track the player's highest score across multiple games.
- Create control input options such as mouse movement and a button to choose your preferred input.
- Power-ups to increase the player's movement speed.
