# Milestone-Project-1-Anthony-Ghilardi

## Description

The objective of this game is to collect as many coins as possible within one minute. To accomplish this goal you will begin the game by clicking the "Start Game" button. This will begin the timer and allow you to move your character. Control inputs and other instrcutions can be found below. How many coins can you collect? Remember to have fun! 

## Deployment

My deployed game can be found at [(https://anthony-ghilardi.github.io/Milestone-Project-1/)]

## Game Logic

When you begin the game a series of randomly generated coins will spawn across the play area. The player will have the choice to collect any coin in any order they please. Upon collecting the coin the score counter will increase by one. After collecting all coins present within the play area a new series of coins will spawn onto the map and the player will continue to collect coins until the one minute timer expires. Once the one minute timer expires the player will be presented with a game over screen which includes their final score and instructions on how to restart/replay the game.

How to start the game:
- Click the "Start Game" button
- This will begin the one minute timer
- This will also create the play area and allow for you to begin moving your character

Control Inputs:
Each key should be pressed and held down to maintain movement:

- W = Moves character Up
- S = Moves character Down
- A = Moves character Left
- D = Moves character Right

Multiple keys can be pressed at once to cause diagonal movement:

- W + D = Moves the character diagonally Up and to the Right
- W + A = Moves the character digaonally Up and to the Left
- S + D = Moves the character diagonally Down and to the Right
- S + A = Moves the character digaonally Down and to the Left

How to restart the game:
- Refresh your browser after being presented with the game over screen.

## Post-MVP Plans

- Restart button which will cause the game to restart, rather than having to refresh the browser.
- Local leaderboard to track the players highest score across multiple games.
- Different control inputs such as mouse movement, possibly a button to choose which input you prefer.
- Power-ups to increase the player movement speed.
